- 👀 I’m interested in integration and data analysis.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to scale support, web app integration, and statistical data analysis efforts across teams, including nonprofit and startup settings.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Django, Vue.js 3, Kubernetes, SQL, Google Data Studio, Zapier/Integromat, CI/CD, Monitoring/Alerting, and more!
